# My Portfolio

In this portfolio I tried to follow a cyberpunk/neon-city style. For the neon letters I used Warnes font from google font and to match the style I used the downloaded font Glitch Goblin to gives the letters that glitch effect.

For the color selection, I used [this](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/61235) color palette to keep a consistent style.

Also, for the title, I created a animation to give it a glowing effect.

For the file organization, I used images, fonts and styles folders to keep everything tidied up and created a css file for each section of the page, keeping everything that is common on the index.css file. Lastly, I used a variables.css files where i declare the colors as variables to use them later in other files.

Last but not least, I have validated the html with [W2C](https://validator.w3.org/) and the accesibility with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/).
